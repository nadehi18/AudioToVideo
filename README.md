AudioToVideo is a small program made in Python to be a GUI wrapper for FFMPEG to make a video from a audio file and single image.
Theoretically any format supported by FFMPEG should be supported but so far the only ones tested are MP3 and WAV for audio and PNG and JPG for images.

# Dependencies:

**ffmpy**

**ffmpeg**

**tkinter**


# If using Windows Executable:

You will need this Microsoft Visual C++ Package which you can find [here.](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf&displaylang=en)

Also, you will need to install [ffmpeg for Windows](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) and also add the ffmpeg binary to your PATH variable.
